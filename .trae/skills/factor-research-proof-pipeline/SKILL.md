# Factor Research Proof Pipeline

Use this skill when the task is to reproduce a factor family end to end inside `agentmatrix-research`, and the output must include code, validation evidence, and reusable artifacts for interns or agents.

## Primary Goal

Turn a factor idea or factor family into a repeatable back-end research bundle with:

- normalized `FactorResearchSpec`
- reusable panel implementation
- evaluation metrics
- truth-source comparison when available
- proof package and formal report
- API or CLI handoff for front-end or agent orchestration

For production-oriented A-share research, use `amazingdata` as the internal data source through:

```bash
python -m research_core.factor_lab.cli check-amazingdata
python -m research_core.factor_lab.cli run-factor-research --factor-set wq101 --data-source amazingdata --start 2023-01-01 --end 2025-12-31 --universe csi800
```

If amazingdata is unavailable, stop and report the missing local ClickHouse/tunnel/config condition. Do not replace it with demo data unless the user explicitly asks for a smoke test.
Named amazingdata universes must be index-filtered and intersected with point-in-time listing status from `ods_security_status_daily`; use `--universe all` only when coverage-based listed-equity selection is the intended research design. Warmup history may be used for factor computation, but proof/evaluation windows must be trimmed to the requested start and end dates.

## Invocation Conditions

Invoke this skill when:

- a user asks to reproduce `Alpha101`, `Alpha191`, `Alpha158`, `Barra`, or paper factors
- a user asks for “proof”, “无偏差校验”, “真值对照”, or “formal report”
- an intern workflow needs to be standardized
- an agent workflow must be made repeatable across factor families

Do not use this skill for front-end page building. Keep UI work in the dedicated front-end repository.

## Required Process

1. Read the current contracts, existing family specs, runtime layout, and validation rules in `research_core/factor_lab/`.
2. Preserve existing working paths such as `qlib_lab` and `gtja191_lab`; only add incremental capabilities.
3. Normalize the target factor or factor family into `FactorResearchSpec` entries.
4. Implement factor logic with reusable operators instead of ad hoc scripts.
5. Run aligned factor computation on deterministic or real data.
6. Export:
   - catalog and specs
   - factor frame
   - evaluation report
   - proof JSON
   - sample reconciliation
   - truth comparison artifact when available
   - formal research report
   - batch proof summary with overall status and blocker factor lists when the family supports grouped proof
7. Run targeted tests and diagnostics for changed files.
8. State clearly whether the result is:
   - `planned`
   - `implemented`
   - `partial proof`
   - `passed proof`

9. Record lifecycle promotion only when evidence supports it:
   - `implemented` after formula tests pass
   - `internal_validated` after real-data quality and validation gates pass
   - `strategy_candidate` after target weights are generated from the same factor frame
   - `external_sim_ready` after GM/PTrade/QMT package export
   - `external_sim_passed` only after returned terminal evidence is parsed
   - `live_ready` and `live_approved` only with explicit human approval

## Proof Rule

Never claim “fully reproduced”, “zero bias”, or “100% no-error proof” unless all of the following exist:

- formula and field mapping checks pass
- sample point reconciliation exists
- multi-period evaluation artifact exists
- external truth comparison artifact exists
- proof status is `passed`

If the external truth source is not available, the correct wording is `partial proof`, not final proof.

If only internal amazingdata validation is available, the correct wording is `internal validation passed`, not `ready for live trading`.

## Output Checklist

Before handoff, ensure the workspace contains:

- updated code in `research_core/factor_lab/`
- updated docs under `docs/`
- one or more `SKILL.md` files when the workflow is meant to be reusable by agents
- passing tests for the edited scope
- exported runtime artifacts under `runtime/factor_lab/`
- truth CSV validation output when external truth is part of the workflow
